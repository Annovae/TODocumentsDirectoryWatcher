TODocumentsDirectoryWatcher is an open-source singleton module, designed to observe your iOS app's Documents directory, and post NSNotifiction messages whenever it detects that a file/folder is added, renamed, or deleted within it.

The goal of this module is to be able to explicilty detect when a user has modified the contents of the Documents folder from outside the app, such as the documents sharing window in iTunes on Mac/PC, even if the app was closed in the interim.

This originally started off as an implementation in my iOS app, iComic (http://icomics.co) in order to detect when a user had dragged a comic file from their Desktop into the app itself via iTunes, so that the app may start importing/processing the file once it's finished copying. I've made it open-source in the hopes that others may find it useful, and might know of ways to help improve it.

## How to Test
### iPhone Simulator
1. Navigate to the iPhone Simulator's Applications directory: *~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/{iOS Version}/Applications*
2. Locate the TODocumentsDirectoryWatcher app in the Applications directory, and start adding files into its 'Documents' folder.

### Native iOS Device
Instructions on how to do iOS documents sharing on native devices is available on Apple's website: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4094

## Features
* Can detect when a batch of new files is added to the Documents directory, and will notify the system after all of the files have finished copying.
* Using the Unix file-system structure, it can detect when files in the Documents directory have been renamed.
* Can detect when a file has been deleted from the Documents directory.
* Using cached snapshots of the Documents directory, these file operations can be tracked even if they've occurred while the app was closed.
* Performs all of its work in serial dispatch queues for maximum responsiveness.

## Technical Requirements
iOS 4.0 or above.
